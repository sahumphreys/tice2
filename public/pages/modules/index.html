        <p>The <a href="http://computingeducationresearch.org">Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre</a>, together with <a href="https://www.computingatschool.org.uk">Computing At School</a>, have established a partnership that brings together teachers who are interested in participating in classroom-based research projects.</p>
<p>Many teachers are already conducting small 'action research' projects as part of their school research interests; others might like to but their school is not actively involved in action research, and so you are not sure where to start. Whichever of these camps you are in, we felt it would be good to provide some structure and support around the process.</p>
<p>Classroom-based research is an excellent form of professional learning as it is directly linked to issues in the classroom and the real-world context. The findings that you might have from an investigation can add to your understanding of your own teaching and what might work in other schools.</p>
<p>The world of research literature, data collection and analysis and writing up projects can seem daunting, so partnering academics who have experience in these areas with teachers who have genuine problems to solve, is a productive way forward.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>To support teachers wishing to conduct classroom-based research projects in their schools</li>
<li>To provide teachers interested in classroom-based research with a peer network of support</li>
<li>To facilitate collaboration between universities and schools for the scoping and planning of future research projects</li>
</ul>
<!-- ## Tips for Success

Having run the project several times we have learned a few key things that will help you achieve success and get to the finish line:

### Inform your Senior Leadership Team

It really helps to have the support of your line managers.  We require attendance at two face to face meetings and ensuring you get cover for these days will be essential.  Funds are available to support this where required.

Be prepared to discuss what you are doing, current status and next steps with your line manager so they are aware. 

### Collaborate

It can be hard to find a "buddy" to work with you on your project especially when you work in a small department.  We will provide you with an experienced "helper" who is available for help at every step of the way but having a co-worker on your project can also help if possible.

### Narrow your focus

Some issues are just too big to tackle in the time available ...
