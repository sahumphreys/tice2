The [Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre](http://computingeducationresearch.org), together with [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk), have established a partnership that brings together teachers who are interested in participating in classroom-based research projects.

Many teachers are already conducting small 'action research' projects as part of their school research interests; others might like to but their school is not actively involved in action research, and so you are not sure where to start. Whichever of these camps you are in, we know the TICE project will provide structure and support to support your teaching. 

Classroom-based research is an excellent form of professional learning.  It is directly linked to issues in your classroom and thus a real-world context. The conclusions reached will add to your understanding of your own teaching and may well be relevant to colleagues in other schools. 

The world of research literature, data collection and analysis and writing up projects can seem daunting, so partnering academics who have experience in these areas with teachers who have genuine problems to solve, is a productive way forward.

## Objectives

- To support teachers wishing to conduct classroom-based research projects in their schools
- To provide teachers interested in classroom-based research with a peer network of support
- To facilitate collaboration between universities and schools for the scoping and planning of future research projects

TICE was first run in 2016 with [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/), with the generous support of Google and is being run again in 2023/2024 with over 20 teachers participating. The second iteration is called TICE2. We now hope to be able to run this initiative every year or at least every two years.

### Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre

The Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre is based in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge. The Centre is a joint initiative between the University and the Raspberry Pi Foundation and offers an exciting opportunity to combine expertise from across both institutions to deliver a step-change in computing education. The Centre seeks to achieve long-term impact by conducting original research as well as working with its partners to turn new research results into practice, including by working closely with the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s educational programmes. 

The aim of the Centre is to increase our understanding of teaching and learning computing, computer science, and associated subjects, with a particular focus on young people who are from backgrounds that are traditionally under-represented in the field of computing or who experience educational disadvantage.

### Computing At School

CAS is the subject association for Computing education in the UK.

Founded in 2008, CAS was instrumental in re-envisioning computing education in England, leading the way in a global movement. So far, CAS has supported over 44,000 teachers and others across the UK through its Communities of Practice, community-generated resources, discussion forum and professional development events.
