The Teacher Inquiry in Computing education (TICE) project provides classroom teachers with the opportunity to work with experienced researchers and academics to carry out their own research.  The goal is to enable teachers to take a deep dive into a curriculum topic, a pedagogical approach, or a new resource or to address a wider issue such as gender diversity or accessibility to inform a change in practice.

TICE was first run in 2016 with [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/), with the generous support of Google and is being run again in 2023/2024 with over 20 teachers participating. The second iteration is called TICE2. We now hope to be able to run this initiative every year or at least every two years.

As well as an initiative to support teachers this is also a research project on how teacher research is a valuable form of professional development for teachers of computing.
