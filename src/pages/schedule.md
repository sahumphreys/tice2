The project is designed to work around you and the school year.  It can be hard to add in just one more thing into a packed year but it is designed to be manageable.

During the first term there will be:

- a monthly webinar
- a monthly "How is it going?" meeting
- reading
- activities to consolidate your research


Please note, the deadline for submission of the final report for inclusion in the final report is **{{ site.deadline}}**
