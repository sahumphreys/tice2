The **Teacher Inquiry in Computing Education** (TICE) project supports computing teachers in conducting action research projects within their schools as part of their classroom activity.

- Action research, involving experimentation and reflection on teaching practice, is a powerful form of professional development.
- It empowers teachers, providing autonomy over their learning, unlike traditional CPD models that follow a delivery approach.
