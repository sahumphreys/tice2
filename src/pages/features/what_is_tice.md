The project enables classroom teachers to work with other researchers on a topic and systematically investigate that topic through a process of enquiry and reflection.

The goals being to improve teaching and learning and enhance student outcomes.

Action research can help teachers become more effective educators, make informed choices about teaching style and content and contribute to the literature on the pedagogy of computing.
