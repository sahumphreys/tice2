The course runs during the Autumn and Spring terms. 

During the first term you can expect a series of monthly webinars covering the key material to ensure the success of your project.  You will also have meetings, as you choose, with your mentor, to ensure the project is workable for you.

The second term will be when the classroom based research will take place followed by analysis of the data gathered and a short report summarising your findings and conclusions.

It is hoped that as many participants as possible will be able to present their reports at the Computing At School National Conference in June/July.
