To support in your project some additional reading is provided here on the practice and theory of action research.  We'll consider some of the common approaches to the methodology and how it has been used to improve practice in both educational and non-educational settings.

Teachers can often feel threatened by 'theory' especially when it is inferred that those providing the theory have limited classroom practice and do not understand our particular situation.  However, action research is so embedded in the notion of practice, and of our own practice, that these feelings should be lessened.  Action Research is is centred on **our** practice, with **our** students, in **our** school, in **our** local community.  You, the teacher, are situated at the heart of the question and take the role of learners.

Sometimes the process of creating your on path through the project can be as illuminating as the conclusions at the end of the process.

At all times remember: 

> How can I improve what I am doing?


The overall process takes the following thought process:

- What am I concerned about either in my teaching or my students?
- What has prompted this concern?
- What can I do about it?
- What will I do?
- How can I judge if I've been successful?
- Am I sure my judgements are correct and fair?
- What will I do next?
