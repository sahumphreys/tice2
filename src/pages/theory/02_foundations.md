Action research is a method where practitioners research their own practices to evaluate and improve them. It involves self-reflection and critical examination of one's actions to determine their effectiveness. 

If practices are satisfactory, practitioners provide evidence to support this. If not, they take action to improve and produce evidence of the improvement. 

This research is done by practitioners themselves, making it also known as practitioner-led or practitioner-based research, and it can be conducted in any context. Unlike traditional research, which involves studying others, action research involves studying oneself in collaboration with others, treating all participants as colleagues. 

It combines learning through action and reflection and is often associated with educational research due to its focus on learning and growth. 

Action research is not a standalone concept but a process where people interact and share beliefs, commitments, and hopes. It provides a theoretical framework guiding practice, helping researchers understand their ontology, epistemology, methodology, and socio-political goals.

## Aspects of the research process

Action research, like all research, involves more than just activities; it requires data gathering, reflection, evidence generation, and making knowledge claims based on validated evidence. Reports should not just describe activities but also explain them in terms of the researcher’s values, intentions, and purposes. For example, a researcher helping others become more confident reflects values of respect and can claim their influence when people demonstrate increased confidence. Key concepts in educational research include:

- **Ontology**: the theory of being or how we view ourselves
- **Epistemology**: the theory of knowledge, including its acquisition
- **Methodology**: the processes and methods used

Educational research is inherently political and socially embedded, aiming to illuminate, explain, and improve human interaction in educational settings. The main purpose of action research is to generate knowledge that improves understanding and experiences for social benefit.

### Ontology

**Beliefs of Action Researchers: Ontological Issues**

Action researchers believe in the ability of people to create their own identities while respecting others' ability to do the same. They strive to accommodate multiple value perspectives and to live harmoniously despite differences. This involves hard work, understanding others' viewpoints, developing care, and suspending prejudices.

Their commitment to creating good societies requires courage to act and speak, often in contested ways, envisioning a better future that starts with improving present relationships. They recognize the danger of settling into stasis if they abandon their vision due to current troubles, believing even small improvements bring hope.

Action researchers prioritize ensuring their own lives are in order before judging others, involving honest critique of their practice, building on strengths, and addressing weaknesses. They believe learning should transform into purposeful personal action for social benefit.

These ontological assumptions are often expressed in values like truth, social justice, compassion, and respect for pluralism. While they live in contexts where these values are often upheld in principle but denied in practice, they aim to understand and change these realities to align with their values.

### Epistemology

Epistemology studies what we know and how we come to know it. 

Traditional scientific enquiry views knowledge as independent, existing externally in books and databases, and separate from its creators. In contrast, action researchers see knowledge as a dynamic, evolving process, generated from lived experiences. Knowledge is never static or complete, continually developing with new understandings, and reality is seen as an unpredictable evolution. Answers transform into new questions in this view, making the process of inquiry ongoing.

Learning is rooted in experience and involves reflecting on practice to determine alignment with values and deciding on future actions. Critical episodes can intensify learning, but learning also occurs continuously in daily life, often peripherally and without conscious effort. Accelerated by critical awareness and intellectual study, learning involves making new connections and reconfiguring existing knowledge for practical use, often beyond conscious awareness.

### Methodology

Action researchers regard learning and experience as processes which enable individuals to make choices about who they are and how they are together. 

However, people’s choices often conflict, so they have to be negotiated and accommodated.  This can be difficult, we need to see one another’s point of view. The methodology of action research is that people ask questions such as ‘How do I do this better? How do we understand?’ They do not aim for consensus or harmony, but they do try to create spaces of tolerance to negotiate differences.This can happen because reflection on action is an inherent part of an action research methodology. 

Reflection on action makes sense, however, only when practice is seen as in relation with others, a process of dialogue and encounter. This view has implications for how people understand their practice especially in relation to colleagues, our institution and the national system. 

Action researchers regard their work as ensuring that encounters with others are opportunities for learning and growth. When they reflect on practice they are reflecting on their relationships with others, and whether those others have benefited from the encounter. This can be a major test for judging the quality of the practice: has the other person benefited from the encounter? The implications are awesome.
