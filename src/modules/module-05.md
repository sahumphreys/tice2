The data collection phase is a critical part of any action research project, ensuring that you gather the necessary information to evaluate the impact of your intervention.

## Establish your goal

Knowing your goal is essential, of course.  What is the purpose of your intervention?

When defining a goal for data collection in an action research project, consider what specific insights or outcomes you want to achieve from the data. For example:

1. **Evaluate the Effectiveness of an Intervention**

   - **Goal:** Determine if the new teaching method improves student learning outcomes.
   - **What to Learn:**
     - Changes in student performance before and after the intervention.
     - Students' understanding and mastery of the subject matter.
     - Comparative effectiveness against traditional methods.

2. **Understand Student Engagement**

   - **Goal:** Assess how engaged students are during lessons.
   - **What to Learn:**
     - Levels of participation and interaction during classes.
     - Student interest and motivation in the subject.
     - Factors that enhance or hinder student engagement.

3. **Identify Learning Gaps and Needs**

   - **Goal:** Discover areas where students struggle the most.
   - **What to Learn:**
     - Specific topics or concepts that are difficult for students.
     - Common misconceptions or errors.
     - Areas needing additional support or resources.

4. **Assess Attitudes and Perceptions**

   - **Goal:** Gauge student or teacher attitudes towards a particular subject or teaching method.
   - **What to Learn:**
     - Students' or teachers' feelings about the intervention.
     - Perceptions of the learning environment and instructional practices.
     - Satisfaction and overall experience.

5. **Measure Behavioral Changes**

   - **Goal:** Observe changes in student behavior related to the intervention.
   - **What to Learn:**

  - Feedback from students on their experience with PBL.

By clearly defining what you want to learn from the data, you can design a focused and effective data collection plan that provides meaningful insights to inform your teaching practice and research objectives.

## Quantitative vs Qualitative

The main difference between quantitative and qualitative research is the type of data they collect and analyze.

**Quantitative research** collects numerical data and analyzes it using statistical methods. The aim is to produce objective, empirical data that can be measured and expressed in numerical terms. Quantitative research is often used to test hypotheses, identify patterns, and make predictions.  Typically, quantitative research will use surveys with closed questions, test scores, measurements and numerical observations etc..

Quantitative research allows you to confirm or test a hypothesis or theory or quantify a specific problem or quality.

**Qualitative research**, on the other hand, is descriptive and deals with qualities or characteristics that cannot be measured numerically. The focus is on exploring subjective experiences, opinions, and attitudes, often through observation and interviews or surveys with open-ended responses.

Qualitative research allows you to understand concepts or experiences.

Some questions lend themselves to a mixture of the two, known as **Mixed Method Research**.  It is highly likely, for this type of research being carried out here that you will be adopting a mixed method approach and will have a collection of both quantitative and qualitative data.

## Primary vs Secondary

**Primary data** is something you collect yourself specifically for the research project, for example interviews and focus groups, but also asking children to draw (e.g. what does a  computer scientist look like)

**Secondary data** already exists for another purpose but is useful to your research question - for example student projects, schemes of work, school documentation

## Tools for Data Collection

### Qualitative data collection

There are a number of instruments and tools you can use to gather your qualitative data e.g.

- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Journal/Diary
- Artefacts
- Observations
- Documents 

**Interviews/Focus Groups**

Interviews are better with adults or post-16 students, while focus groups work better with younger age-groups.  It might sound obvious but plan the questions beforehand checking that each will be contributing to your research question.  With some groups asking them to complete a short activity as part of the interview/focus group can work well.

If you wish to record the session, then ensure that you seek permission beforehand (including parents as appropriate).

It can be easy to fall into the trap of "research bias" and ask leading questions that are designed to support your hypothesis.  All questions should be unbiased prompts designed to collect data and must not be skewed in such a way that leads the participant(s) to answer in a particular way.

By way of example, given the research question: ***How do computing teachers use LLMs***?

Section 1: Teachers' Experience with LLMs (Approx. 7 Minutes)

- 1.1 Can you briefly describe your current understanding of LLMs such as ChatGPT?
- 1.2 Have you used any LLMs in your teaching practice? If yes, in what context?

Section 2: Perceived Benefits and Challenges (Approx. 10 Minutes)

- 2.1 What do you see as the potential advantages of using LLMs in the educational context?
- 2.2 What concerns do you have regarding the use of LLMs in education (e.g., ethical concerns, plagiarism)?
- 2.3 Are there specific challenges you anticipate when implementing LLMs in your subject area?

Section 3: etc..

**Artefacts**

Artefacts such as homework, programs, projects, and screenshots can be valuable data in an action research project. These artefacts provide concrete evidence of student work and progress. However, it is crucial to anonymize student projects before sharing them outside your school to protect student privacy. Additionally, you should check your school policy regarding the use of anonymized projects to ensure compliance with consent requirements, as policies may vary on whether you need explicit consent to use such data.


**School documentation**

School documentation, including schemes of work, lesson plans, policies, and learning materials, are all useful data sources. These documents can provide insights into the planning and delivery of the curriculum and how it aligns with educational goals. As long as they are anonymized (school name removed), consent is not normally needed to use these materials. This allows for the sharing and analysis of instructional strategies without compromising the privacy of the school or its staff.

**Journals and Unstructured Observations**

Journals and unstructured observations can provide rich qualitative data for an action research project. These might include writing (or audio recording) your own reflections after a particular lesson or event, observing a colleague’s lesson and making notes (or vice versa), or writing a journal entry regularly for a period of time. These methods allow for a deep exploration of teaching practices, student interactions, and classroom dynamics from a reflective and subjective perspective.

**Structured Observations**

Structured observations, sometimes called systematic observations, involve completing a form during the lesson to record specific events at certain times. This method can generate quantitative data, providing a more objective and consistent way to measure and compare different aspects of classroom activity. Structured observations can help identify patterns and trends in teaching and learning, offering valuable insights for data-driven decision-making in educational practice.

**Observations, journals and diaries**

Journals and unstructured observations can provide rich qualitative data for an action research project. These might include writing (or audio recording) your own reflections after a particular lesson or event, observing a colleague’s lesson and making notes (or vice versa), or writing a journal entry regularly for a period of time. These methods allow for a deep exploration of teaching practices, student interactions, and classroom dynamics from a reflective and subjective perspective.

### Quantitative Data Collection

**Questionnaires (sometimes called surveys)**

Questionnaires are versatile tools that can be used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from students, teachers, or other stakeholders. When designed with closed-ended questions (e.g., multiple-choice, Likert scale), they generate numerical data that can be statistically analyzed. This makes them useful for measuring attitudes, opinions, and self-reported behaviors.

**Logs from Software**

Logs from educational software can provide a wealth of quantitative data. These logs can include metrics such as time spent on tasks, number of attempts, completion rates, and performance scores. This type of data is particularly useful in understanding student engagement and identifying patterns in learning behaviors.

**Systematic Observations**

As discussed earlier, systematic observations involve completing a form during lessons to record specific events at certain times. This method generates quantitative data that can be analyzed to identify trends and measure the frequency of certain behaviors or interactions in the classroom.

**Test Results**

Test results are a direct source of quantitative data, providing measurable outcomes of student learning. Standardized tests, formative assessments, and summative exams can all yield valuable numerical data that can be analyzed to evaluate student performance, instructional effectiveness, and areas needing improvement.

**Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Data**

While questionnaires can be used to collect numeric data, they can also include open-ended questions to gather qualitative insights. This combination allows for a more comprehensive analysis, where numerical data can be complemented by rich, descriptive feedback. Understanding the context behind the numbers can provide deeper insights into the data and inform more effective interventions.

### Types of Quantitative Data

Numeric data can be categorized into two main types: discrete and continuous.

**Discrete Data:**

Discrete data refers to countable items or measurements that take on distinct, separate values. This type of data is often whole numbers.

- **Examples:** Shoe sizes, ages, number of students in a class.
- **Ordered Discrete Data:** This type includes values that can be ranked or have a logical order.
  - **Examples:** Age, test scores.
- **Unordered Discrete Data:** This type includes values that do not have a specific order.
  - **Examples:** Eye color, marital status, type of complaint.

**Continuous Data:**
Continuous data refers to measurements that can take any value within a given range and are often obtained by measuring.

- **Examples:** Temperature, height, weight, time.

Continuous data can provide more detailed information as it allows for a wide range of values, including fractions and decimals, giving a finer level of precision compared to discrete data.

Understanding the types of numeric data is crucial for selecting appropriate data collection methods and statistical analyses, ensuring that the data gathered is accurately represented and effectively utilized in an action research project.
