<div class="abstract">
Formulating a good research question is crucial as it guides the direction and focus of your study. A well-defined question helps clarify the purpose of the research, ensures that the investigation is manageable, and facilitates the collection of relevant data. Ultimately, it lays the foundation for meaningful and impactful findings.
</div>

At the heart of the project will be the **question**.  Identifying the question can present the most challenging aspect of action research.  

It starts with the **topic**.

## Select the topic of interest

The topic is the general area of enquiry.  

Clearly, when deciding on the general topic it should be an area of interest to you as this will have a direct impact on your motivation.

Examples from an educational context might be:

1. **Enhancing Coding Skills**
2. **Improving Computational Thinking**
3. **Integrating Technology in the Classroom**
4. **Promoting Inclusivity and Diversity**
5. **Assessing Learning and Progress**
6. **Developing Soft Skills**
7. **Curriculum Development**
8. **Use of Emerging Technologies**
9. **Teacher Professional Development**
10. **Student Motivation and Engagement**

Brainstorming and/or concept mapping can help develop the topic into subtopics and then through to the question.  

### Brainstorming the topic

[Brainstorming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) is a tried and tested method for generating a wide range of ideas and solution for a particular problem and you've probably used it in your own classrooms at some point.  The focus is on quantity and creativity without being overly concerned about organisation structure.  Free thinking and generation of ideas is key.

Taking the first topic, Enhancing Programming Skills as an example, one might generate the following list of ideas:

- Pair programming
- Flipped classroom
- Use of online coding platforms
- Comparison of IDEs
- Version tracking
- Hand-coding
- Gamification
- Project-based learning
- Code Reviews
- Scaffolding
- Peer assessment
- Cross curricular applications
- Professional mentoring
- Using physical computing
- ...

### Concept Mapping

The [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) is an associated technique that draws out the connections between concepts in a topic.  Here key concepts are identified and systematically arranged to illustrate the relationships.

For example, with the topic **Enhancing Programming Skills** one might come up with:

## Literature Review

For our purposes the fact that a particular question has been researched and investigated before does not preclude you from testing the same question, building resources and evaluating with your students.  We may have heard from others about how the use of physical computing tools such as the [Micro:Bit](https://microbit.org) has engaged students in a neighbouring school and you'd like to try it out for yourself.

However, spending time reviewing what has been researched previously can be illuminating and helps to narrow the focus of the research question.

Access to research literature can be difficult for teachers as many academic papers are behind a paywall but there are some avenues open to use that are worth exploring:

- Search engine: perhaps the starting point for most of us
- [Hello World](https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world): back copies of the magazine produced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and their special publications such as the [Big Book of Computing Pedagogy](https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world/issues/the-big-book-of-computing-pedagogy) and [Big Book of Computing Content](https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world/issues/the-big-book-of-computing-content)
- TODO: OTHER SOURCES

If, as part of your search, you encounter an academic paper you would like to read, do get in touch and we can see if can arrange access.

## Narrow down the topic

Once you have gathered enough knowledge on the topic you want to pursue, you can start focusing on a more specific area of study and narrowing down a research question.

There are some useful approaches, additional questions, here that can help you arrive at the final question to be researched e.g.

- Feasible:  Do you have enough time to complete the research?  Is the question within your own ability?
- Interesting: Is this of interest to you?  Will it be of interest to others?
- Novel: Will the question bring new insights?  To you?  To others?
- Ethical: Is is appropriate?
- Relevant: Is it relevant to your professional development?  To your department colleagues and school?  To the wider community?

## Structuring your question

A framework can help here.  One of the most popular is the PICOT framework:

- Population: Describes the group of students being studied.  Who will be the subjects?  Which age of student?  Any other characteristics e.g. gender, ethnicity etc..
- Intervention: Specifies the action or strategy being implemented to address the problem perhaps a new teaching tool or method.
- Comparison: Describes what your intervention will be compared with/to eg. project-based learning vs lecture-based instruction
- Outcome: Defines the desired result or what you hope to achieve such as improvements in student performance, engagement or understanding
- Time: Specifies the time frame over which the intervention and outcomes will be measured.

For example, you may be interested in the use of [PRIMM](https://primmportal.com) and a first stab at your question might be:

> Does using PRIMM help program comprehension?

Looking at the headings above, how might this be improved?

- Population:

> Does using PRIMM for Year 8 help program comprehension?

- Intervention:

> Does using a targeted predict exercise at the beginning of Year 8 programming lessons help program comprehension?

- Comparison:

> ??

- Outcome:

> Does using a targeted predict exercise at the beginning of year 8 programming lessons help my students explain their programs orally during the lesson?

- Time:

> Does using a targeted predict exercise at the beginning of year 8 programming lessons for 4 weeks help my students explain their programs orally during the lesson?

## Summary

Developing the right research question is a critical first step in the research process. 

- The development of a research question is an iterative process that involves continuously updating oneâ€™s knowledge on the topic and refining ideas at all stages.
- Keep updated on the topic you are researching
- Use brainstorming and concept mapping to get an overview of your topic
- Make the research question as specific and concise as possible to ensure clarity. Use a framework such as PICOT to help.
- Aside from doing a literature review, seek the input of experts in the field, mentors, and colleagues.
