Over the past eight months a team of teachers have been using Action Research to reflect on an aspect of their teaching.  There has been a huge variety in the nature of the topics they have been investigating covering both primary and secondary education.

The [final report](#) has now been published.

The teachers’ reports describe:

- the questions they wanted to address, 
- what they did, 
- their personal reflections, and 
- the results from their studies. 
 
The topics they have selected emerged naturally from the very real issues they were either concerned or curious about from their own classrooms.  These have been investigated from a their perspective and so will be of interest to all computing teachers interested in improving their practice. 

The teachers were paired with a more experienced academic/researcher to help guide their process though none of the final reports can be claimed to have been peer-reviewed.  They focus on a specific context and provide very specific insights into teachers’ practice and experience which provides their value.

## Primary Phase

From the primary phase there have been three investigations:

- **Impact of using Litterbox on debugging skills**: Rachael Coultart has investigated the use of LitterBox, a program analysis tool emanating from a research project in Germany, to support upper primary school children in code comprehension, debugging skills and perseverance. 
- **Deepening understanding of abstraction in block-based languages**: Justin Heath has adapted the Block Model for code comprehension into his own model called FLARE, and investigated how this might be used in a primary context. 
- **Which PRIM activities lend themselves to assessment?**: Jo Hodge has investigated both how PRIMM can be used as a formative assessment tool for primary children, and also the experiences of her colleagues using PRIMM for the first time. 

It has been so good to see these investigations yield positive results.  In each case 

From Rachel's experience debugging is challenging and her more confident programmers found that using Litterbox was a real incentive to improve their projects and also helped her own debugging skills.

Justin developed the FLARE framework to improve code comprehension and demonstrated the importance of clear definitions, scaffolding and interactive questioning when teaching programming to this age group.

Finally Jo concluded that using *any* PRIMM activity supports assessment btu especially those where they have to predict the outcome from any given code e.g. code reading or Parson's Problems acting as excellent starter activities to focus attention.


## Key Stage 3

- **What is the impact of introducing artificial intelligence concepts and hands-on projects into the Key Stage 3 (Year 9) computing curriculum?** Helen Copson wanted to know the impact of AI on motivation to pursue Computing at GCSE
- **How does participation in a data science art project influence Year 9 students’ perception of the relevance and usefulness of computing?**  Sophie Fenn followed a similar line of thinking re motivation for progression and looked into a cross-curricular approach
- **Can explicit teaching of computational skills actually improve computational thinking?** John Ionides wanted to explore how explicitly teaching computational thinking might help his students approach new and challenging problems, especially those set in the Bebras competition.
- **How does student engagement differ when using Scratch compared to Kodu for introducing computing concepts at the KS3 level?** Rebecca Mack compared the students’ perception of and engagement in programming using Scratch and Kodu, reporting that her students found Kodu more accessible and engaging. 

Two projects focused on issues of diversity, particularly gender balance in computing:

- **What are the factors that influence girls’ decisions to choose or not to choose Computer Science as a GCSE option in the context of our school?** Alex Price used focus groups and surveys with the girls in her school to investigate what would influence their choice (or not) to choose GCSE computer science, with three emerging themes of usefulness, difficulty and interest
- **Integration of Computing across subjects** Ashish Upadhyay, our one non-UK teacher, investigated how, where computing is not in the curriculum, it can be introduced into other subjects.

## Key Stage 4

Finally, within the context of GCSE Computer Science (students aged 14–16) classes:

- **Impact of feedback on students’ engagement and progress in KS4 Computer Science: Can AI replace a good programming teacher?** Pete Dring systematically looked at types of feedback and asked students what is most helpful. Something we all wrestle with no doubt and it is perhaps no surprise to see that his students preferred to get any feedback on their work directly from their teachers!
- **The impact of hand-writing programs on the accuracy of the code produced** Lorne Pearcey investigated the impact of hand coding in programming, reflecting that the students enjoyed the hand-coding exercises and that it improved their confidence and accuracy in writing code.  Given that several awarding organisations require this approach in the exam this made for very interesting reading.

It's not possible to do justice to the range and diversity of these fascinating reports here btu I encourage you to download the latest report.

Finally, our sincere thanks to all those who participated in the project this year, and those volunteers who worked alongside them.  We will be running the project next year, so watch this space on how to apply.
